ata warehouse - subject oriented [sales, business, customer], integrated, time variant [historical data], non volatile [not modified] collection of data in support of decision making process. 

Collect data, transform and shared data such as an excel, ppt or report without no reliable data process. 
Issue of handling big data.
If there is a need for an integrated report of multiple data source then it is a problem.

ETL [extract, transform, load] loads data to warehouse from multiple sources. Automated process and its faster. 

ETL + Data warehouse = data eng
Consume data warehouse + build report + models = data analysts

ETL = Extract, Transform, Load - 

Extract - identify data we need from source and dont need to change anything.
Transform - change shape of data , cleansing, formatting, normalizing, new formatting
Load - Take transformed data and load into target [data warehouse]

Dont have to use complete ETL. It depends on data architecture. 

            Extraction Method
            Pull Extraction, Push Extraction

            Extract Types
            Full Extraction [all records pulled]
            Incremental Extraction [identify new chnaging data]


            Data Extraction Techniques
            Manual - access source system and extract manually
            DB Querying - connect to db and run query
            File Parsing - parse parse to warehouse
            API
            Event Based Streaming
            CDC - changed data capture
            Web Scraping - code

            Transformation
            Data Enrichment -
