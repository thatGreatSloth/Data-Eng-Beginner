ata warehouse - subject oriented [sales, business, customer], integrated, time variant [historical data], non volatile [not modified] collection of data in support of decision making process. 

Collect data, transform and shared data such as an excel, ppt or report without no reliable data process. 
Issue of handling big data.
If there is a need for an integrated report of multiple data source then it is a problem.

ETL [extract, transform, load] loads data to warehouse from multiple sources. Automated process and its faster. 

ETL + Data warehouse = data eng
Consume data warehouse + build report + models = data analysts

ETL = Extract, Transform, Load - 

Extract - identify data we need from source and dont need to change anything.
Transform - change shape of data , cleansing, formatting, normalizing, new formatting
Load - Take transformed data and load into target [data warehouse]

Dont have to use complete ETL. It depends on data architecture. 

            Extraction Method
            Pull Extraction, Push Extraction

            Extract Types
            Full Extraction [all records pulled]
            Incremental Extraction [identify new chnaging data]


            Data Extraction Techniques
            Manual - access source system and extract manually
            DB Querying - connect to db and run query
            File Parsing - parse parse to warehouse
            API
            Event Based Streaming
            CDC - changed data capture
            Web Scraping - code

            Transformation
            Data Enrichment - add values to dataset
            Integration
            derive column
            normalize and standardize
            business rules and logic
            data aggregation 
            Data cleansing 
                    duplicates
                    filtering
                    missing data
                    invaliad
                    unwanted space
                    type casting
                    outlier detection


            Load
            Full Load
                 truncate + insert - make table empty then insert
                 upsert - update insert, update all record,then insert
                 drop [table]. create, insert


            Incremental Load
                upsert
                append
                merge



            Processing 
            Batch - load in one big batch - one time
            Stream - if there is a change, then process it ASAP. [real time dw]


Slowly Changing Dimensions 

    no historization - no update
    overwrite old valye [lose history]
    historization - insert new record, no loss of history
